 Ideas for syntax

 "/\<.*\>/,fg=blue,bg=black"

 Allow for predefined keywords that come with the program.

 EMAIL,fg=blue,bg=black  Match all e-mail addresses
 URL,fg=red
 DOMAIN,bg=blue Match things that look like domains/hostnames
 DEFAULT,fg=blue,bg=black

  All keywords should do a case insentive match unless it doesn't make sense to.

  Other keywords:
     HTMLTAG
     FILEPATH
     WHITESPACE  (spaces, tabs)
     

 Limited flag support.  So /\<.*\>/ will match first and /\<.*\>/g will match all on line.
 i - case insensitive matching.

 Order of expressions: Highest priority is given right to left.
 So if multiple things match, an expression on the right will override one on the left arguments.

 What to do about existing color sequences?  Remove them? Allow them to be replaced, that could be neat.

 Should multiple line expressions be allowed?  Could use perl's /m flag.
