Below are some future goals and features for clide:

- Global config system where definitions and
  expressions are preinstalled in /etc/clide and
  you can call in what you need for a specific purpose
  with a -p option, like for firewall log analysis.

- Column based expressions (like $1, $2 in awk)

- Line number based expressions

- Search range expressions like in sed.

- Unicode support

- Support for 256 foreground and background colors or
  an arbitrary number of colors.

- Ability to support overlapping patterns without the
  text itself changing. For example, if you had two
  expressions like this:
    /open source/,fg=red
    /source software/,fg=blue

  Both expressions would match portions of the string 
  'open source software' and you would end up with open being red
  and source software being blue according to expression
  precidence.
  
- Abstraction of output for ability to output to other
  display forms like HTML/CSS.

- Multiple line expressions.

- Inclusion into various distro packaging systems like
  Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, RHEL/CentOS extras repos and
  others.
