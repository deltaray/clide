Below are some future goals and features for clide. If you are 
interested in participating in the project, you should check this
list. I've put difficulty ratings next to each item so that you 
can judge whether you'd be able to help with that item.

- Make a deb package                                    [EASY if you know how]

- Provide more examples for usage and new search        [EASY]
  expression definitions.

- Global config system where definitions and            [EASY]
  expressions are preinstalled in /etc/clide and
  you can call in what you need for a specific purpose
  with a -p option, like for firewall log analysis.

- Column based expressions (like $1, $2 in awk)         [EASY]

- Line number based expressions                         [EASY]

- Search range expressions like in sed.                 [EASY to MODERATE]

- Unicode support                                       [MODERATE]

- Support for 256 foreground and background colors or   [MODERATE]
  an arbitrary number of colors.

- Abstraction of output for ability to output to other  [MODERATE]
  display forms like HTML/CSS.

- Ability to support overlapping patterns without the   [MODERATE]
  text itself changing. For example, if you had two
  expressions like this:
    /open source/,fg=red
    /source software/,fg=blue

  Both expressions would match portions of the string 
  'open source software' and you would end up with open being red
  and source software being blue according to expression
  precidence.

- Try to make clide faster.                             [MODERATE to HARD]

- Support for 'm' flag in pcre expressions.             [MODERATE to HARD]

- Inclusion into various distro packaging systems like  [NOT IMPOSSIBLE]
  Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, RHEL/CentOS extras repos and
  others.
