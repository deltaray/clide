clide - WARNING
-----------------------------------

This is one of the first public released versions of clide. There
may be lots of issues and who knows what it might do to your data.
I'd strongly recommend that you only use it for display purposes.
In other words, don't use it to make new data to work from, it
wasn't really meant for that.
